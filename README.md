**When playing this game there are 2 app.js files, one for each game, they are named accordingly 

	When creating this game I had a hard time with formating the banner as well as some of the connections from server to client.
The first time i tried to send over data from the server side i was unable to figure out how to send it over, and what format was acceptable.
At first i tried sending through a string, and it ddint work, so i tried to send through a color. Which did work. After experimenting with the
formating i figured out it was the recipient that needed to be changed in order to recive all kinds of information.

	The banner was somehow the hardest part of the project. I continue to have a hard time formating the text
and am not sure to to change the look of text depending on the size of the box its on. I got it to work but the formatting is not to my
expectations whatsoever.

	I did enjoy programming the buttons and centralzing the code, so that only one socket was needed in order to change all four panels. 
Other than that most of it was a semi-learning experience so i didnt have the easiest time with the assignment.

	the game works by have the code recognize that there are 2 people in the server, and depending on what game ou want to play
you will either be assigned one color for both players or red for player 1, and blue for player 2. After this you will be able to press
the buttons at corresponds with the color assigned to you. If there is a third player they will not be able to play. The server will
stop you from connecting to an already started game. 

	In the competitive game you play against the other person and try to turn all the panels your assigned color using the buttons. And for the
collaborative game you work together with the other person and you try to turn all the panels the same color. After you will see how long you both took 
to do so. After the games are finished you may restart the game for both players.
